To create a new repo, you'll use the git init command. git init is a one-time command you use during the initial setup of a new repo. Executing this command will create a new .git subdirectory in your current working directory. This will also create a new main branch. 

Versioning an existing project with a new git repository
This example assumes you already have an existing project folder that you would like to create a repo within. You'll first cd to the root project folder and then execute the git init command.
